# tensor-mev-bot
Bot that allows you to do "MEV" sales on tensor. 

Software allows you to list your NFT for example for 0.5 SOL and buyer sees 0.5 SOL, but the actual cost of NFT is 5 SOL (which he doesn't see)

I won't tell what exactly it does under the hood because it may be a threat to software, but I personally made 3k USD on this.


Written fully in golang, support JITO bundles and very fast performance.
